/**
 * Project-level Tauri type augmentations placeholder.
 *
 * This file intentionally contains no runtime code â€” it's a place to add
 * TypeScript declarations or module augmentations for Tauri APIs if needed.
 *
 * Examples you might add here in future:
 *  - declare global interfaces used across the app
 *  - augment Window with custom properties
 *  - provide extra module declarations for third-party libs
 *
 * Keeping this file prevents confusion from an "empty file" and serves as
 * a single place for future type customizations.
